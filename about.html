        <h1>About HTMLDiary</h1>
        <p>For my first website I am following the HTML & CSS development course created by <a href="https://youtu.be/HGTJBPNC-Gw?si=e3Dc2BQg67PvtsXz" target="_blank">Bro Code</a> on YouTube. It is a 4-hour comilation of tutorials and the author does not accept donations for their work, asking to help those in need instead. The video is a fundraiser towards St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, and they have already raised more than eight thousand dollars for the cause!</p>
        <p>At the moment I'm learning about pseudo-elements</p>
        <p>My favourite features so far are:</p>
        <ul id="features">
            <li id="classes">Class selectors</li>
            <li id="pclasses">Pseudo-class selectors</li>
            <li id="links">Links to other pages</li>
            <li id="lists">Unordered lists</li>
            <li id="padding">Padding of elements</li>
        </ul>
